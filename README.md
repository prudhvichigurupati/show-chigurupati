## My favarite food: Briyani
Biryani is my favorite dish because it perfectly blends aromatic spices, tender meat, and flavorful rice into a single meal. The combination of textures and the burst of flavors in every bite make it irresistible. I love how it brings people together during celebrations and special occasions.
